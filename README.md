<b>Task 2: Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data. </b>
<p>The foundation of any successful data science project is rooted in meticulous data preprocessing. During my internship, I was entrusted with the task of handling a raw dataset that presented itself as a puzzle with missing pieces. Under the guidance of experienced data scientists, I acquired expertise in the techniques of data cleaning, feature scaling, and managing missing values. Leveraging Python's libraries, I transformed the unstructured data into a organized and meaningful dataset. This endeavor underscored the importance of maintaining data integrity and imparted upon me the skills to adeptly navigate real-world data challenges.</p>
